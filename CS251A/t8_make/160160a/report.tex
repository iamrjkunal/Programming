 \vspace{30pt}
 A single line graph for each thread configuration where X-axis is num-of-elements and Y-axis is
 average execution time over 100 samples

 \vspace{30pt}
 One bar graph with X-axis as number of elements and Y-axis as average speedup  w.r.t. one thread execution.

 \caption{This is bar graph for all threads with error terms .}
 \vspace{30pt}
 One bar graph with X-axis as number of elements and Y-axis as average speedup  w.r.t. one thread execution with error bars.  Where error bars represent the variance calculated
over 100 samples for a particular configuration.
