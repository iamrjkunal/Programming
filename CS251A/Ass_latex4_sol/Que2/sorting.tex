\section{Introduction}
Sorting is one of the most fundamental operations in computer science useful in numerous applications. Given a sequence of numbers as input, the output should provide a non-decreasing sequence of numbers as output. More formally, we define a sorting problem as follows [1], \\
\textbf{Input:}A sequence of \textit{n} numbers $\langle a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} \rangle$. \\
\textbf{Output:}\hspace{1 cm} A \ reordered  \ sequence \ (of size \textit{n}) \\ 
$\langle a'_{1},a'_{2},...,a'_{n} \rangle$ of the input sequence such that $a'_{1}\leq a'_{2}\leq ...\leq a'_{n}$ \\
Consider the following example. Given an input sequence$\langle8, 34, 7, 9, 15, 91, 15\rangle$, a sorting algorithm should return $\langle7, 8, 9, 15, 15, 34, 91\rangle$ as output. 

A fundamental problem like sorting has attracted many researchers who contributed with innovative algorithms to solve the problem of sorting \textit{efficiently} [3]. Efficiency of an algorithm depends on primarily on two aspects,
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Time complexity} is a formalism that captures running time of an algorithm in terms of the input size. Normally, \textit{asymptotic} behavior on the input size is used to analyze the time complexity of algorithms.
  \item \textbf{Space complexity} is a formalism that captures amount of memory used by an algorithm in terms of input size. Like time complexity analysis, asymptotic analysis is used for space complexity.
\end{itemize}
In the branch of algorithms and complexity in computer science,  spacecomplexity takes a back seat compared to time complexity. Recently, another parameter of computing i.e., energy consumption has become popular. Roy et al. [4] proposed an energy complexity model for algorithms. In this document, we will deal with time complexity of sorting algorithms.

One class of algorithms which are based on \textit{element comparison} are commonly known as \textit{comparison based sorting algorithms}. In this document we will provide a brief overview of \texttt{Quicksort}, a commonly used comparison based sorting algorithm [2]. Quicksort is a sorting algorithm based on \textit{divide-and-conquer} paradigm of algorithm design. Further, we will derive the lower bound of any comparison based sorting algorithm to be $\Omega(\textit{n} \ $log$_{2} \ \textit{n})$ for an input size of \textit{n}.
\section{Quicksort}
Quicksort is designed as a three-step divide-and-conquer process for sorting an input sequence in an array [1]. For any given subarray, \textit{A}[\textit{i}..\textit{j}], the process is as follows, \\
\textbf{Divide:} The array \textit{A}[\textit{i}..\textit{j}] is partitioned into two subarrays \textit{A}[\textit{i}..\textit{k}] and \textit{A}[\textit{k+1}..\textit{j}] such that all elements in \textit{A}[\textit{i}..\textit{k}] is less than or equal to all elements in \textit{A}[\textit{k+1}..\textit{j}]. A partitioning procedure is called to determine \textit{k} such that at the end of partitioning, the element at the \textit{k}$^{th}$ position (i.e., \textit{A}[\textit{k}]) does not change its position in the final output array. 
\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{ Partition procedure of \texttt{Quicksort} algorithm}
  \label{algo:quick_sort1}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
     \Procedure{Partition}{\textit{A}, \textit{i}, \textit{j}}\newline
     \Comment{\textit{A} is an array of \textit{N} integers, \textit{A}[1...\textit{N}]} \newline
     \Comment{ \textit{i} and \textit{j} are the start and end of subarray}
      \State $x \leftarrow$ \textit{A}[\textit{i}]
      \State $y \leftarrow$ \textit{i} -- 1
      \State $z \leftarrow$ \textit{j} + 1
      \While {(\textit{true})}
          \State $z \leftarrow z - 1$ 
          \While {($A[z] > x$)}
            \State $z \leftarrow z -1$ 
         \EndWhile
         \State $y \leftarrow y + 1$ 
         \While {($A[y] < x$)}
            \State $y \leftarrow y + 1$ 
         \EndWhile
         \If{$y < z$}
            \State {Swap} $A[y] \leftrightarrow A[z]$
         \Else 
            \State {return} \textit{z}
         \EndIf
      \EndWhile
     \EndProcedure 
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}\\
\textbf{Conquer:}Recursively invoke \texttt{Quicksort} on the two subarrays. This procedure conquers the complexity by applying the same operations in two subarrays.\\
\textbf{Merge:} Quicksort does not require merge or combine operation as the entire array A[\textit{i}..\textit{j}] is sorted
in place.

In the heart of \texttt{Quicksort}, there is a partition procedure as shown in Algorithm 1. A pivot element \textit{x} is selected. The first inner while loop (line \#6) continues examining elements until it finds an element that is smaller than or equal to the pivot element. Similarly, the second inner while loop (line \#9) continues examining elements until it finds an element that is greater than or equal to the pivot element. If indices \textit{y} and \textit{z} have not exchanged their side around the pivot, the elements at \textit{A}[\textit{y}] and \textit{A}[\textit{z}] are exchanged. Otherwise, the procedure returns the index \textit{z}, such that all elements to the left of \textit{z} are smaller than or equal to \textit{A}[\textit{z}] and all elements to the right of \textit{z} are greater than or equal to \textit{A}[\textit{z}].

The main recursive procedure for Quicksort is
\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{\texttt{Quicksort} recursion.}
  \label{algo:quick_rec}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
     \Procedure{Quicksort}{\textit{A}, \textit{i}, \textit{j}}\newline
     \Comment{ Quicksort procedure called with \textit{A}, 1, \textit{N}}
         \If{$i < j$}
            \State $k \leftarrow \textsc{Partition}(\textit{A}, \textit{i}, \textit{j} ) $ 
            \State \textsc{Quicksort}(\textit{A}, \textit{i}, \textit{k} ) 
            \State \textsc{Quicksort}(\textit{A}, \textit{k} + 1, \textit{j} ) 
         \EndIf
     \EndProcedure 
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm} \\
presented in Algorithm 2. Initial invocation is performed by call QUICKSORT(A, 1, \textit{N}) where \textit{N} is the length of array N.
\subsection{Time complexity analysis of \texttt{Quicksort}}
The worst case of \texttt{Quicksort} occurs when an array of length \textit{N}, gets partitioned into two subarrays of size N-1 and 1 in every recursive invocation of QUICKSORT procedure in Algorithm 2. The partitioning procedure presented in Algorithm 1, takes $\Theta(n)$ time, the recurrence relation for running time
is,
\[\textit{T}(n) = \textit{T}(n-1) + \Theta(n) \]
As it is evident that \textit{T}(1) =$\Theta(1)$, the recurrence is solved as follows,
\begin{align*} 
T(n) &= T(n-1) + \Theta(n) \\
&=\sum_{k=1}^{n} \Theta(k) \\
&=\Theta\Bigg(\sum_{k=1}^{n} k\Bigg) \\
&=\Theta(n^{2})
\end{align*}

Therefore, if the partitioning is always maximally unbalanced, the running time is $\Theta(n^{2})$. Intutively, if an input sequence is almost sorted, \texttt{Quicksort} will perform poorly. In the best case, partitioning divides the array into two equal parts. Thus, the recurrence for the best case is given by,
\begin{equation*}
    T(n) = 2 T\Bigg(\frac{n}{2}\Bigg) + \Theta(n)
\end{equation*}
which evaluates to $\Theta(n \ $log$_{2} \ n)$. Using a comparatively involved analysis, the average running time of \texttt{Quicksort} can be determined to be $O(n \ $lg$ \ n)$.
\section{Lower bounds on comparison sorts}
An interesting question about sorting algorithms based on comparisons is the following: What is the lower bound of this class of sorting algorithms? This question is important for algorithm researchers to further improve the sorting algorithms.

A decision tree based analysis leads to the following theorem [1].\\ \\
\textbf{Theorem 1.} \textit{Any decision tree that sorts n elements has height} $\Omega(n \ $log$_{2} \ n)$. \\ \\
\textit{Proof.} Consider a decision tree of height \textit{h} that sorts \textit{n} elements. Since there are \textit{n}! permutations of \textit{n} elements, each permutation representing a distinct sorted order, the tree must have at least \textit{n}! leaves. Since a binary tree of height h has no more than $2^{h}$ leaves. So,\\ \\
\textit{n}! $\leq$ $2^{h}$ \\ \\
Applying logarithmic (log$_{2}$), the inequality becomes, \\ 
h $\geq$ \ lg(\textit{n}!) \\ \\
Applying Stirling's approximations,\\ \\
$\textit{n}! > \Bigg(\cfrac{n}{e}\Bigg)^{n}$ ,\\
where \textit{e} is natural base of logarithms. Further,
\begin{align*}
    h &\geq \lg \Bigg(\cfrac{n}{e}\Bigg)^n \\
    &=n \lg n - n\lg e \\
    &=\Omega(n \lg n)
\end{align*}\hfill\boxed{}
